# Wood Turning

## My first web project
This is the products page for a wood turning company.  Shown here is the desktop view however it is fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices using HTML5 and CSS3.  I choose dark and light colors to stand out.  The wood chip background colors have been adjusted to flow with the color scheme.
